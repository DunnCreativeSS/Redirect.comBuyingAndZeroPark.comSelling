# Redirect.comBuyingAndZeroPark.comSelling
A script that maximizes inputs and outputs to optimize profits while buying traffic on Redirect.com and selling on ZeroPark.com

This script expects a file results.txt with campaign names then a comma then campaign IDs from Redirect.com.

This script expects your target URL for ZeroPark to have the Target name (ie. the part of the URL preceding the ?) to match exactly the Campaign Name as specified on Redirect.com.

Don't use the provided results.txt file - replace it with your own campaigns.
